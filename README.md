# Algorithm Challenge #48 – Custom Floor Function in C++

🧮 Challenge Description 
-
In this challenge, we implement the mathematical **floor** operation manually,
without using the built-in `floor()` function in C++.

The floor function returns the greatest integer that is **less than or equal**
to the given number. Special care is required when dealing with negative values.

---

📊 Floor Logic Explained
-
- Positive numbers → return the integer part
- Negative numbers → return (integer part - 1)

Examples:
- 7.9   → 7  
- 4.1   → 4  
- -3.2  → -4  

---

🛠️ Concepts Covered
-
- Type casting from float to int
- Understanding floor behavior for negative numbers
- Conditional logic in C++
- Writing clean and predictable mathematical functions
- Comparing custom logic with standard library functions

---

🧪 Example Execution
-
**Input:**  
Enter Float Number  
-6.4  

**Output:**  
My Floor = -7  
C++ Floor = -7
